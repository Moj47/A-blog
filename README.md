# Blog Project

Welcome to my Blog project! This is a beginner-level application developed following the Laravel Daily guidance. While I borrowed a lot from the provided views (front-end isn't really my jam!), I took the time to dive deeper into the back-end, implementing tests and factories to enhance functionality.

## Features

- User-friendly blog interface
- Full-featured back-end capabilities
- Automated tests to ensure functionality
- Database factories for seamless data generation
  (I alomst Copied all parts of Views because i don't like front-end XD but i add some extra features like Factory and tests)
